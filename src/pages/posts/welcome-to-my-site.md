Welcome to my new personal website

I intend to use this website as an expression of myself and my creative style. There are a lot of things I’d love to do to make it more of a reflection of myself but I can expect they’ll be never-ending… and so I work slowly.

The first version of finbarmaunsell.com was great. Plain html, css and an image. The thought was there but it took a long time to get it out.
2nd version: used a website template, looked nice.
3rd version: This is the current version. I’m using [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), a static site generator which converts markdown files to html, css and javascript. It is a react application and I plan to implement a little redux to make things more fun (you’ll see what I mean). The site is hosted through Netlify and can be found on my github repo (H3yfinn). Using Gatsby is really simple and helps to make the maintenance process pretty easy.

Best,

Finn
