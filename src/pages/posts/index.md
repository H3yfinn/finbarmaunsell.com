title: "My decision to study online"
---

In 2016 I started university at Canterbury after taking a year off to delay the decision about what I wanted to study. I figured out that computer science would be my best bet to getting me working in an industry that I cared about. Sure I liked the idea of working with tech and the opportunities involved (chance to make a difference, being involved in the future etc.) but the main factor was the wide range of career opportunities available. Fast forward to the end of the year and it had finally sunk in just how much university was costing. Having always been one to try things differently I started to do the math. One lecture would cost $50! I had even started watching free MIT lectures online for more relevant information (Try doing MIT first year computer science courses instead of yours, you’ll see what I mean).

Through doing online courses during university I began to realise the possibilities of online learning. I started asking more and more questions of what I was doing whilst becoming more convinced that online learning was part of the future of education. Yet I still wouldn’t have imagined myself fully studying online at the same time the next year.

The point where I decided to change was after getting work experience at the Downer Group HQ in Auckland. After working with a few of the developers there and seeing what they were doing I saw what university actually provided. A generic skillset and a piece of paper to prove it. Plus a hefty loan. I didn’t want a generic skillset. I hated the idea of having this ‘piece of paper’ to prove I was better than someone without them ever looking at me. Plus that loan was limiting my opportunities by pressuring me to stay in NZ after university - I seriously thought about my loan and when it would be paid back by. I think I had predicted it’d be fully payed off at 40yrs. No one  wants that in their life.  -
So anyway, I was driving with my uncle talking about the future of employment and I asked if he’d hire someone who had studied a full degree’s worth of free Computer Science courses through MIT. He said he would… Surprise! It all started from there. 

My intention at the start was to complete a full degree using a variety of the best university courses in the world. (ie. Coursera, Edx https://www.coursera.org/ https://www.edx.org/ I ) - I actually ended up studying Nanodegrees through Udacity.
 I would live off savings collected in years past and only get a job when things looked dire - at the time I didn’t want a job to distract me from my focus however now I realise the possible benefits of having that distraction.
I wrote a big plan (wish I could find it!) outlining the positives/negatives etc. 

Positives:
-ability to study using the best content available
-2x speed lectures! ( actually a big help )
-no tests and therefore no remembering useless things. (Programming exams were the most soul destroying)
-learn from a wide range of topics definitely not available at Canterbury
-skip pre-class/lecture admin!

-chance to do something radical!
-Learn how I best learn and do so accordingly. 
-learn how to manage myself without being told how

Negatives:
-Lonely (Miraculously two of my friends decided to study online with me)
-No student loan to cover living expenses
-I wouldn’t be invited to as many flat parties
-Would it work?
-Stress
-Mystery of whether an employer would actually employ me at the end of it all

You may have seen above that I mentioned two friends who decided to study online with me. This was after attending the Singularity University Conference in Christchurch and listening to Sue Suckling (Chair of the NZQA board) talk about her views on education and it’s future. (reaaally good TEDX style talk actually  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56FwkZ7olak ).
I can’t imagine what this year would’ve been like without them there. 

As the cutoff to university applications came closer and closer I started to take on a stubborn and almost messianic attitude to my decision to do this thing which noone had ever done. I even thought of myself as a test rat for education. Good thing my mates were there to keep me grounded and make it seem so much more normal. 
I think that although I thought this was a very unique thing, since life is so unique in itself I now see it as just an example of how everyone has his/her own unique stories. 
This post was about the reasoning behind me studying online, I’ve done another post about the actual experience and I’m sure there’ll be a post in the future regarding any afterthoughts on the experience (once I get into the workforce!).
