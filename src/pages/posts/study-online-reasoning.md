title: "My decision to study online"
---

This post is meant to be a source of reason behind me deciding to pursue self directed study. The decision was carefully thought out and was a result of my situation and who I am. In this post it may seem like I'm taking an anti-university stance but really I've just realised what most people already knew (university is expensive, it's not a meal ticket, yah dee yah). Early on this post was called 'why I left university'. I don't like that title because it bases the post on my action of 'leaving uni' instead of 'studying online'. It's important to highlight the fact that I decided to study online and becuase of that I had to leave university. Otherwise, University is where I'd want to be. 

In 2016 I started university at Canterbury after taking a year off to delay the decision about what I wanted to study. I figured out that computer science would be my best bet to getting me working in an industry that I cared about. Sure I liked the idea of working with tech and the opportunities involved (chance to make a difference, being involved in the future etc.) but the main factor was the wide range of career opportunities available. Fast forward to the end of the year and I was beginning to understand the system. I was paying $50 a lecture and these lectures came with opportunities to make friends, explore different interests, learn with the aid of a class tutor and an entryway into the jobs market as long as I kept my grades up. It was kind of worth it. 

My attitude was to explore as many interests as possible using what was available to me and maintain at least a C average as long I felt I was keeping up in class. My intention in keeping a C average was to maximise the other opportunities that were available to me while learning evrything they taught us, just not spending needless hours studying for exams when I could be doing more productive things. 

I guess what lead me to think seriously about studying online was when I started using online resources to complement or even substitute lectures. Some resources (eg. [MIT opencourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)) were more up-to-date and taught what I felt was more applicable knowledge. If I was to be going to uni just to learn instead of getting high grades then why shouldn't I just learn from these online resources instead of doing some university courses? (perfect example, first year programming course in Python. Cost $800 when I could have learnt that online for free - yet I couldn't because it was 'required')
I started asking more and more questions of what I was doing whilst becoming more convinced that online learning was part of the future of education. Yet I still wouldn’t have imagined myself fully studying online at the same time the next year.

The point where I decided to change was after getting work experience at the Downer Group HQ in Auckland. After working with a few of the developers there and seeing what they were doing I saw what university actually provided. I knew for sure that the skillset these developers had could be learnt online. I then talked to my uncle about this and asked him  if he’d hire someone who had studied a full degree’s worth of free Computer Science courses through MIT opencourseware. He said he would… Surprise! 

It all started from there. 

My intention at the start was to complete a full degree using a variety of the best university courses in the world. (ie. [Coursera](www.coursera.org), [Edx](www.edx.org)) - I actually ended up studying Nanodegrees through Udacity.
 I would live off savings collected in years past and only get a job when things looked dire - at the time I didn’t want a job to distract me from my focus however now I realise the possible benefits of having that distraction.
I wrote a big plan (wish I could find it!) outlining the positives/negatives etc. 

Positives:

-ability to study using the best content available

-2x speed lectures! ( actually a big help )

-no tests and therefore no remembering useless things. (Programming exams were the most soul destroying)

-learn from a wide range of topics definitely not available at Canterbury

-skip pre-class/lecture admin!

-chance to do something radical!

-Learn how I best learn and do so accordingly.

-learn how to manage myself without being told how


Negatives:

-Lonely (Miraculously two of my friends decided to study online with me)

-No student loan to cover living expenses

-I wouldn’t be invited to as many flat parties

-Stress

-Mystery of whether an employer would actually employ me at the end of it all

You may have seen above that I mentioned two friends who decided to study online with me. This was after attending the Singularity University Conference in Christchurch and listening to Sue Suckling (Chair of the NZQA board) talk about her views on education and it’s future. (reaaally good TEDX style talk actually  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56FwkZ7olak ).
I can’t imagine what this year would’ve been like without them there. 

As the cutoff to university applications came closer and closer I started to take on a stubborn and almost messianic attitude to my decision to do this thing which I thought noone had ever done. I even thought of myself as a test rat for education. Good thing my mates were there to keep me grounded and make it seem so much more normal. 
I think that although I thought this was a very unique thing, since life is so unique in itself I now see it as just an example of how everyone has his/her own unique stories. 
This post was about the reasoning behind me studying online, I've made another post about the actual experience of studying online and I’m sure there’ll be a post in the future regarding any afterthoughts on the experience (once I get into the workforce!).
