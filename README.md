This is my personal website. It uses gatsby as a static site generator.

To do:

-Fix hacks. ie. I have my images (that are used) in public so they can be seen by both md and components(like about.js). I'd like to put them into src/pages/images or at least somewhere more tidy. <- mum i promise my code is tidy!

-Implement an ability to read my blog from a 'serious' vs. 'party' mode. will involve Implementing state id say.

-make the general atmosphere a bit more fun. I want the site to fun to visit!

-A cool not-as-generic Footer

-get a favicon

-On some mobile's the resume page looks pretty ugly. This doesn't actually show from dev tools so need access to the right size mobile (Iphone5 and a bigger one, seemed like the latest Iphone[42?]). Potentially the page will need to be quite different in mobile view.
